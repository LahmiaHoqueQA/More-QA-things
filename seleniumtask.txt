Task 1:

    "1. Create a Working Selenium Project:\n"
    "   - Set up a new project in IntelliJ
    "   - Install the required dependencies (e.g., Selenium library for Java). Ensure you have the WebDriver installed (e.g., ChromeDriver for Chrome).\n",

    "2. Retrieve the URL of Google:\n"
    "   - Use Selenium to open a browser and navigate to 'https://www.google.com'.\n",
    
    "3. Search for Cats:\n"
    "   - Locate the search box using its element selector (e.g., name, id) and input the search term 'cats'.\n"
    "   - Submit the search form.\n",
    
    "4. Get the Title of the Page:\n"
    "   - After the results load, choose a specific result (e.g., the first one).\n"
    "   - Retrieve the title of the page using `driver.title`.\n",
    

Additonal Goal:

    "5. Print the URL of the Image:\n"
    "   - For the selected result, find the image and get its URL.\n"
    "   - Print the URL to the console or save it to a file.\n"



For reference the BeforeClass should look something like the following:


    @BeforeClass
    public static void setUP() {
        System.setProperty("webdriver.gecko.driver", "src/test/resources/webdrivers/geckodriver.exe");

        driver = new FirefoxDriver();
        driver.manage().window().fullscreen();
        System.out.println("Starting..");
    }
